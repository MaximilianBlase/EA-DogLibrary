# EA-DogLibrary
Embedded C library for EA-DOG lcd displays on avr microcontrollers

# Abstract
This embedded c library provides the possibility to print everything you want on an Electronic Assembly lc-display with 128x64 pixel. E.g. text, mathematical figures, or complete pictures. The difference to other existing librarys is, that you are not bound to "pages" with 8 pixel height.

# Needs
* lc-display like EA-DOGL-128
* avr microcontroller like atmel ATmega644pa
